Before running any python script please run ```chmod +x ./setup.sh ``` and then ``` ./setup.sh ```. This bash script installs python requirements, sets up necessary directories etc.

My thesis will be released soon on my [website](https://yannisza.github.io/).

This repository is a work in progress. The following tasks have to be completed
- [ ] Make doubly constrained spatial interaction model class compatible to the singly constrained model class.
- [ ] Complete `generate_figures.sh` script.
- [ ] Improve comments on model classes and argsparse descriptions in inference classes.
- [ ] Write tests for all classes.
- [ ] Release outputs in nice format.

Give the repository a star and fork it if you like it!
